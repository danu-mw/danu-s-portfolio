# ✅ Disclaimer Update - Testimonials Included

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Update Type:** Content Enhancement

---

## 🎯 Objective
Update the Disclaimer section to explicitly mention that testimonials are also prototype/sample content, maintaining transparency with visitors.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Fourth Info Box

**New Box - "NPC Dialogue" 💬**

```jsx
<div className="box-icon">💬</div>
<div className="box-content">
  <h3>NPC Dialogue</h3>
  <p>The testimonials? Think of them as placeholder NPC quotes — the real endorsements 
     will come from actual quest companions once the campaign launches!</p>
</div>
```

**Game Dev Analogy:**
- "NPC Dialogue" = Non-Player Character quotes
- "Placeholder NPC quotes" = Sample testimonials
- "Quest companions" = Real clients
- "Campaign launches" = Going live with real projects

### 2. Updated Intro Text

**Before:**
```
everything you see here right now is in prototype mode. 😂🥹
```

**After:**
```
everything you see here right now is in prototype mode. 😂🥹 
The skills, projects, achievements, and even those glowing testimonials 
are all part of the beta build.
```

**Added clarification:**
- ✅ Explicitly mentions "glowing testimonials"
- ✅ Groups testimonials with other prototype content
- ✅ Maintains playful game dev tone
- ✅ Clear about beta/prototype status

### 3. Updated Grid Layout

**Disclaimer Boxes:**
- **Desktop:** Auto-fit grid (minmax 240px)
- **Tablet (768px):** 2 columns (2x2 grid)
- **Mobile (480px):** 1 column (stacked)

**Grid adjustments:**
- Reduced min-width from 250px → 240px
- Reduced gap from 25px → 20px
- Better fit for 4 boxes on desktop
