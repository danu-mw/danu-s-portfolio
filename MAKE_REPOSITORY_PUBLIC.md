On GitHub.com:
1. Click **"Settings"** tab (at the top)
2. Scroll down to the **"Danger Zone"** section (at the bottom)

### Step 3: Change Visibility

In the Danger Zone:
1. Find **"Change repository visibility"**
2. Click **"Change visibility"**
3. Select **"Make public"**
4. Type the repository name to confirm: `danu-s-portfolio`

## What Will Be Public?

✅ **Visible:**

## Quick Access URLs

After making public:

**Repository:** `https://github.com/danu-mw/danu-s-portfolio`
