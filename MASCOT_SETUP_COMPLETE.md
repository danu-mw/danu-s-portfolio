## How to See It

1. **Start/refresh your dev server:**

   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your portfolio in browser**

3. **Look for the character in the bottom-right corner**

4. **Click it to interact!**
   - First click shows welcome message
   - Subsequent clicks cycle through different messages
   - Each message has a unique sprite animation

## Current Message Rotation

1. "Hi! I'm your creative companion! 🎨" (wave animation)
2. "Wow! Check out these amazing projects! ✨" (excited/jump)
3. "Need help navigating? Just click around! 🗺️" (happy)
4. "This portfolio is made with React & Three.js! 🚀" (thinking)
5. "Let's connect! Don't forget to check the contact section! 📧" (celebrate)
6. "Game development and 3D art - the perfect combo! 🎮" (excited/jump)
7. "Every pixel tells a story! ✨" (happy)
8. "Hmm... which project should you explore first? 🤔" (thinking)

## Customization

See `CHARACTER_MASCOT_GUIDE.md` for complete customization options:
- Adding new sprite animations
- Changing messages
- Adjusting position and size
- Modifying bubble styles
- Tuning animation speeds
- Troubleshooting tips

## Technical Details

**Component Type:** 2D HTML/CSS overlay (not 3D)
**Animation Method:** CSS sprite sheet with frame cycling
**Position:** Fixed bottom-right corner (persistent across all pages)
**Performance:** Lightweight - just CSS transforms and background positioning

## What Changed from Original Plan

Originally planned for 3D character models (.glb files), but your CharacterAnimations.zip contained 2D sprite sheets instead. This is actually better because:
- ✅ Lighter weight (no 3D rendering overhead)
- ✅ Retro pixel-art aesthetic matches portfolio style
- ✅ Easier to customize and modify
- ✅ Better browser compatibility
- ✅ Simpler interaction system

The 2D sprite approach is perfect for your game development/pixel art portfolio theme!
